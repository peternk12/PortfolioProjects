**Project Overview: Analyzing Sales and Profitability in a Retail Business**  

This project aims to analyze sales and profitability data for a retail business using Power BI and MySQL. The primary objective is to derive insights into product performance, revenue trends, and profit margins to inform strategic decision-making. The analysis begins with preparing data stored in MySQL, including cleaning and transforming date columns and creating derived metrics like total revenue and profit. Using a relational schema, sales and product data were connected via a primary key, enabling the calculation of product-level profit by combining sales revenue with product costs. Key queries identified the top-performing products, monthly and yearly revenue trends, and overall profit margins. The data was then imported into Power BI for visualization, where interactive dashboards were created to showcase metrics such as top-selling products, revenue by year and month, and profitability trends. This project highlights the integration of SQL-based data preparation and Power BI's visualization capabilities to provide actionable business insights.
